Meta-learning
	Generative vs Discriminative (Generative Feature Extractor) - cross over with episodic?
    Learning to Learn with Feedback and Local Plasticity (combined with regularisation?)
    La-MAML
    MERLIN
    Meta-Experience Replay
	Learning Synthetic Data
		Dataset Distillation using NFR
		Hindsight Anchors - partly episodic too

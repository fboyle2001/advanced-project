Episodic Memory
    FearNet (maybe fits in other instead)
	Image Based
		Real Samples
			GDumb - Greedy, train at inference
			Kernel Continual Learning - Train task-specific classifiers
			Adversarial Shapley Value - Score memory data samples according to their ability to preserve latent decision boundaries
			Gradient Episodic Memory
            Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM)
			Tiny Episodic Memory
            Gradient based Sample Selection
            End-to-End Incremental Learning
            Maximally Intefered Retrieval (also has generative variation)
			Optimisable (Partly meta-learning
				Hindsight Anchors
				Mnemonics
		Generative
			Memory Replay GANs
	Feature Based
		ACAE-REMIND - Store features from intermediate layers of the classifier
		Generative Feature Replay
		Brain Inspired Replay
        REMIND - Features as well
        iCaRL - Stores representation model
    Other
        Co2L

Meta-learning
	Generative vs Discriminative (Generative Feature Extractor) - cross over with episodic?
    Learning to Learn with Feedback and Local Plasticity (combined with regularisation?)
    La-MAML
    MERLIN
    Meta-Experience Replay
	Learning Synthetic Data
		Dataset Distillation using NFR
		Hindsight Anchors - partly episodic too

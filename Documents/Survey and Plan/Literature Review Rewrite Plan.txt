Episodic Memory
	Image Replay
		Real Samples
			GDumb - Greedy, train at inference
			Kernel Continual Learning - Train task-specific classifiers
			Adversarial Shapley Value - Score memory data samples according to their ability to preserve latent decision boundaries
			Gradient Episodic Memory
			Tiny Episodic Memory
			Optimisable (Partly meta-learning0
				Hindsight Anchors
				Mnemonics
		Generative
			Memory Replay GANs
	Feature Replay
		ACAE-REMIND - Store features from intermediate layers of the classifier
		Generative Feature Replay
		Brain Inspired Replay

Meta-learning
	Learning Synthetic Data
		Dataset Distillation using NFR
		Hindsight Anchors - partly episodic too
	Generative 
		Generative vs Discriminative (Generative Feature Extractor) - cross over with episodic?

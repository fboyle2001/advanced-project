Today:
* Read first draft and make changes

Deadlines:
* First Draft: Friday Morning

To-do:
* Change the finetuning figure in the introduction to be 5 separate subfigures --> Do on home PC
* Smooth the transition between sections
* Read the first draft through completely
* Go over the meeting notes I've taken to check for any additional things
* Check over old documents and look at the comments I have left

Want feedback on:
* Headings, should I merge Methodology, Existing Solutions, and Novel Approach into Methodology?
-> don't want to over sub-headers

For second draft:
* Reduce overlap between sections
* Check the references
* Check the unused literature in the citation file

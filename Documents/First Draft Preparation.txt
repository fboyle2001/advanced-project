Tonight:
* Plan out what to change with the results and evaluation
* Full list of experiments

Tomorrow:
* Fix results and evaluations section

Wednesday:
* Finish conclusion and abstract
* Compile (and print) full first draft

Thursday:
* Read first draft and make changes

Deadlines:
* Results and Evaluation: Wednesday Morning
* First Draft: Friday Morning

Data
* I like both First Task forgetting graphs
--> Do I gain much from having both though?
--> Also the CIFAR-10 shows contradicting results for EWC
* Might be worth having the CIFAR-100 First Task Forgetting and Top-1 for CIFAR-10 instead?
* CIFAR-10 0.5k and CIFAR-100 5k are arguably more comparable
* Both variable graphs are good and should be included

Results
* CIFAR-100 5000 Samples
* CIFAR-10 5000 Samples
* CIFAR-10 500 Samples
* CIFAR-100 Variable Sample Size Graph
* CIFAR-10 Variable Sample Size Graph

1. Start by presenting all of the results and different scenarios
2. Compare classification performance measures
3. Identify general trends

Evaluation
* Compare the run times 
* Compare memory usage
* Draw some critical conclusions on when you would use each one

Conclusion
* What have I covered in the project?
* What have I proposed?
* What was the general sentiment of the comparison?
* How does this align with problems identified in the literature review?
* What is the importance?
* What is next?

To-do:
* Move NCM to SCR
* Make sure colours align on all diagrams
* Fix the first bar chart in the introduction
* Change the finetuning figure in the introduction to be 5 separate subfigures
* Clean up the tables in the methodology to make headings clear
* Bold the results that are best in the result tables
* Split the result tables
* Improve description fo the figures (e.g. would expect accuracy to decrease not increase but that is a misinterpretation)
* Smooth the transition between sections
* Reduce overlap between sections
* Read the first draft through completely
* Check the references
* Check the unused literature in the citation file
* Go over the meeting notes I've taken to check for any additional things

Today:
* Read first draft and make changes

Deadlines:
* First Draft: Friday Morning

To-do:
* Move NCM to SCR
* Make sure colours align on all diagrams
* Fix the first bar chart in the introduction
* Change the finetuning figure in the introduction to be 5 separate subfigures
* Clean up the tables in the methodology to make headings clear
* Bold the results that are best in the result tables
* Split the result tables
* Improve description fo the figures (e.g. would expect accuracy to decrease not increase but that is a misinterpretation)
* Smooth the transition between sections
* Reduce overlap between sections
* Read the first draft through completely
* Check the references
* Check the unused literature in the citation file
* Go over the meeting notes I've taken to check for any additional things
* Check over old documents and look at the comments I have left
* Decide if I want graphs to have titles or if they should just be in the figure descriptions

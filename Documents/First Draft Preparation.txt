Today:
* Read first draft and make changes

Deadlines:
* First Draft: Friday Morning   

To-do:
* Read the first draft through completely

Want feedback on:
* Headings, should I merge Methodology, Existing Solutions, and Novel Approach into Methodology?
-> don't want to over sub-headers

For second draft:
* Reduce overlap between sections
* Check the references
* Check the unused literature in the citation file
* Go over the meeting notes I've taken to check for any additional things
* Check over old documents and look at the comments I have left
* Add Novel-RD to the varying CIFAR-10 graph and add it to the results

Result observations on CIFAR-100 at 5000:

DER
- Accuracy: Stable but poor 
- Bottom 5: Awful
- Top 5: Stable but not great
- Very quick, shows in its accuracy results

DER++
- Accuracy: Minorly increasing, outperforms DER but still poor
- Bottom 5: Awful
- Top 5: Minorly increasing but not great
- Very quick, shows in its accuracy results

EWC
- Accuracy: Trends downwards, only technique to experience this
- Bottom 5: Awful
- Top 5: Starts well, trends downwards significantly and ends worse than finetuning
- Quite a large amount of time required to run 

Finetuning:
- Accuracy: Stable but worst overall as expected --> could look into task classification?
- Bottom 5: Awful
- Top 5: Relatively stable, worst of the lot as expected
- Fastest and also the worst by a long way

GDumb:
- Accuracy: Outperforms both SCR and Rainbow! Increasing but begins to plateau
- Reason is that it trains a fresh model each time instead of building on the old one, trade off of time vs accuracy
- Bottom 5: Has ok bottom-5 accuracy overall
- Top 5: Trends downwards but out performs other techniques
- Quite slow especially compared to SCR 

L2P:
- Accuracy: Upwards trend, begins to plateau, high quality performance
- Bottom 5: Awful
- Top 5: Best overall, stable
- Quite slow faster than GDumb

Novel BN:
- Accuracy: Solid performance, trends upwards, outperforms L2P which is other ViT method
- Bottom 5: Good
- Top 5: Rivals L2P not quite as good but pretty good
- Very very slow

Novel RD:
- Accuracy: Basically identical performance to Novel BN
- Bottom 5: Good
- Top 5: Rivals L2P not quite as good but pretty good --> nearly identical to Novel-BN
- Very very slow

Rainbow:
- Accuracy: Upwards trend, quite poor performance though
- Bottom 5: Better than 0 but still very poor
- Top 5: Similar performance to SCR and GDumb, fairly alright
- Nearly as slow as GDumb

SCR:
- Accuracy: Outperforms Rainbow but still relatively poor performance
- Bottom 5: Better than 0 but still very poor
- Top 5: Performs well but still worse than GDumb
- Quite fast

# Project Code, 3pm 23/01/2023
- Show generated results
	- Error analysis: PCA
	- Graphs
- Need the main runner for the result generation
- Novel implementation is the main thing he wants to see
	- Looking at the uncertainty code
	- For the uncertainty code outline algorithm in Latex with relevant equations
- Literature implementations
- Need to have code commented
- Test on laptop

## Experiment Write Up:
- Write up the CE / SCL loss comparisons -> section started
- Write up the MLP experiment -> section vaguely started
- Write up the NCM vs Maximisation of Logits experiment -> section started
- Second uncertainty approach experiment -> closest / second closest quantification -> section mostly written
- --> Need to look at Manhatten vs Euclidean for norm?

## Code demonstration:
- Clean up or cite any code that I haven't wrote
- Figure out what I want to show
	- Algorithms
	- Datasets
	- Result generation
	- Analysis

## To do list:
- Generate results
	- CIFAR-100, need to vary the samples 
	- CIFAR-10 for direct comparison
- Implementation Write Up
- Methodology Write Up
- Code commenting
- Results and Evaluation Write Up
- Conclusion Write Up
- Abstract Write Up
- Presentation Planning
- Presentation Powerpoint
- Revisions and redrafting

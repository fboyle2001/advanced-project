Project Presentation

Introduction
------------
* Intro to machine learning / offline training
* What is catastrophic forgetting?
* Example of catastrophic forgetting
* What is continual learning?
* What is the need for this? Applications?

What makes a good continual learning algorithm?
-----------------------------------------------
* Go through the properties
* Online vs Offline
* Class-IL vs Task-IL

Literature review
-----------------
* Regularisation
* Memory-based
* Meta-learning + why I didn't use them -> they are focused on offline
* Alternatives
* Architecture

Methodology
-----------
* Datasets
* Metrics

Techniques
----------
* Selected techniques -> go a bit in-depth on them
* Cover NCM vs Max
* Cover SCL vs CE
* Cover Uncertainty

My Approach
-----------
* Go in detail about the approach and what it is
* Two different distance approaches
* Go through the full algorithm

Results

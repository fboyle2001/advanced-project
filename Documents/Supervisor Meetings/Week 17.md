# Week 17 Meeting
## First Draft Review
* Been through and annotated things I feel need improving, adding or changing
* Section headings, sort of want to merge Methodology, Existing, Novel but worried about heading depth (x.y.z.w doesn't look right with the template); see page 6, ยง2.1.2.2 Alternative Approaches - looks bad
* Need to align the results and methodology a little better, feel like what I'm saying is a bit convoluted and repetitive
* Couple of other things that are repeated that I need to sort
* Don't think the overlap between Literature Review and Existing Techniques is too bad but needs a bit of work
* Additional result runs are coming together, just lots of running while I'm away from my PC etc
result tbcs are coming together just lots of running while im away etc
* Index terms, are they that important?
* Results for Novel-RD are ready to be added to Fig 8a
* Not overly concerned about page limit at the moment should be able to trim some stuff when necessary
* Not sure what to do about figures, guidance said they should appear before they are referenced but not sure if that's feasible
* Generally though fairly happy with the content

## Next
* Start looking at presentation
* Refining the draft
* Shift focus to coursework and exams a bit now

# End of Week 9

## Literature Review
- Feedback

## Methodology
- All algorithms will have results reported on CIFAR-100
- Each algorithm will be run 5 times and the results will be averaged (mean)
- Will use the same 5 seeds in the same order for all of the techniques
- All images will be 32x32 except for those using ViT as they need to be upscaled to 224x224
- Hyperparameter selection?
- Memory buffer sizes will be 5000 samples for each technique where applicable (could do say 2000, 5000, 10000 etc will see)

## Feature Visualisation
- CIFAR-100 ViT features first 10 classes 
- cloud, bicycle, cattle, bee, table, rose, pickup_truck, tulip, flatfish, spider
- "cloud", "bicycle", "boy", "beetle", "motorcycle", "bus", "aquarium_fish", "trout", "wardrobe", "orchid"
- General grouping, PCA works pretty well
- Can see clustering, need to do more analysis really

## Implementation Write-up
- Ended up spending most of my time on experimentation for the next bit of the project
- Not 100% sure what to write, just a summary of the technique? 
- What it brings that is different to the other techniques?
- What it brings that is different to the other techniques?

## Novel Experimentation
- PowerPoint

## Remaining Stuff to Do
- Follow plan at end of PowerPoint to implement this technique and study it (NE feedback dependent)
- Write up methodology section
- Write up implementations
- Generate results on CIFAR-100 following methodology
- Do I need a validity section? Doesn't appear in others but was in Project Prep?
- Write up about the NE technique (NE feedback dependent)
- Write up conclusions

# Memory Replay GANs - learning to generate images from new categories without forgetting
## Skim Read
### Abstract
- Considers CF in the case of generative models rather than in classification problems
- Offers insight into a different domain
- Proposes Memory Replay GANs

### Summary
- Not a massively relevant paper to the task but offers some insight into how to train a generative model to supplement a classifer for these problems
- Didn't really read it much as it didn't seem too useful for my project
- Method seems decently successful though for its purpose

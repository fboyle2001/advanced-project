# Selective Replay Enhances Learning in Online Continual Analogical Reasoning
- Wasn't really a suitable paper
- Just applies techniques from image classification RL to a different domain
- Shows that these techniques aren't limited to just image classification
- May be useful for the introduction or related works when talking about the use cases or when justifying use of pre-trained ResNet as this can extend to other domains

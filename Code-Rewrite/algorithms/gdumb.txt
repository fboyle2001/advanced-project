Difficulties implementing:
* Big issues with handling the data
* Caused by sampling the transformed tensors instead of the raw images
* Only had len(replay_buffer) samples instead of epochs * len(replay_buffer) samples
* Resolved now

Others:
* Uses a ResNet model but their implementation far outperforms that from torchvision
* Uses cutmix
* Uses SGD with warm restarts
